## Bernoulli Distribution: 
An example of a Bernoulli distribution is a coin toss where 1 could represent heads and 0 could represent tails.
## Uniform Distribution:
A deck of cards has a uniform distribution because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely.
## Binomial Distribution:
An example of a binomial distribution is tossing a coin 10 times. The probability of getting exactly 2 heads (success) is given by the binomial distribution.
## Normal or Gaussian Distribution:
An example of a normal distribution is height. Most people are of average height, the numbers of people that are taller and shorter than average are fairly equal, and there are very few people who are either extremely tall or extremely short.
## Exponential Distribution: 
An example of exponential distribution is the amount of time until a machine part fails.
## Poisson Distribution:
An example of the Poisson distribution is the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour.
